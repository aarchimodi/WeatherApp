To enhance my Web Development skills, I've developed a Weather App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows users to access real-time weather information for cities worldwide. The project leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data and presents it in a user-friendly interface. Key features include:

1. API Integration: Successfully integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch up-to-date weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity and wind speed based on user-provided city names
2. Search Functionality: Implemented a search box feature, empowering users to input city names and instantly receive detailed weather information for the specified location.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enables users to interact with the app effortlessly.
